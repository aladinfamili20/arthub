# Getting Started with Create React App

## Available Scripts

This is a big project, with over 50 files, please take your time to review the CSS files to make sure you are edting on the right file. While creating this project, I never thought I would work with anyone, and due to that reason, I wrote the code based on my preferences.

To save changes, Ctrl + S.

The code is moslly written badly, and I apologize for that.

I will sugest that you start working on the home page, and then move on to the more necessary pages.

There are some files that shares the same CSS file, keep in mind that.

The home page can be found in src/pages/home. From there on, you can hover on a CSS import press the Ctrl key and it will direct you to that file.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start:frontend`

Once you run the script above, a new tab will automatically open on based on you default browser.

Every change you make in the code, will be automatically update once you save them.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Change will update automatically once saved.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Use the script above to run a build, but only if neccessary.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
